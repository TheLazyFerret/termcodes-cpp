# CODESCAPE-CPP
The idea of this small library is abstracting the obscure and complex ANSI
codescapes in a simpler and friendly way.

I chose to simplify the codes as much as possible, so not all codes are
included. In addition, I chose to leave out most codes that are not widely
supported.

Only compatible with unix-line systems. Although only tested on linux.

Please remember that this library is a work in progress.

Using my own [style guide](https://github.com/TheLazyFerret/dots-and-templates/blob/master/cpp/style_guide.md).
